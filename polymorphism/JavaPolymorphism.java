/*
Java Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many 
classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us 
inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism 
uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to 
perform a single action in different ways.
